Data::Presenter uses the Carp module which is part of the standard Perl 
distribution.  Data::Presenter also uses the List::Compare module by 
the same author.  This module is available from CPAN; versions 0.15 
and later should be used.

This distribution comes with four sample Data::Presenter subclass 
modules which illustrate what is required for such a subclass.  In 
addition, the distribution comes with four configuration files, one for 
each sample subclass, which are required to construct a new 
Data::Presenter subclass object.  The distribution comes with four 
sourcefiles, one per subclass.  These sample subclasses are fully 
installed when you install Data::Presenter.  Once you master the 
principles of creating a Data::Presenter invocant subclass you may 
delete these sample files.

From time to time the author writes articles discussing Data::Presenter.  
These articles will be available at http://www.concentric.net/~Jkeen/data.
